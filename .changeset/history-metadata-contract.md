Correct the read-only Hacienda history contract across all four packages. Lists consume metadata arrays, combined domestic party filters and observed 200/206 range headers; details return metadata/references rather than promised XML/status. Reject unsupported date/legacy filters before authentication and propagate SDK/MCP cancellation. Preserve wrapper names and exact identifier strings, with an explicit pre-1.0 minor migration for removed fictional total/status/XML fields. No automatic paging, completeness claim, live Hacienda verification or fiscal mutation changes.
