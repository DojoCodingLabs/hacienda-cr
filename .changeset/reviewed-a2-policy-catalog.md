Align the reviewed A2 runtime subset with official policy/catalog evidence, without importing the unmerged Money migration. Generated XAdES now contains the exact `/xml-schemas/` policy identifier and SHA256 of the retained official PDF. The signer uses xadesjs' supported precomputed `digestValue`; the previous `hash.value` cast was ignored and hashed the identifier XML instead.

Release compatibility: signed policy wire bytes change. Exoneration12 (unsupported by the official XSD) and the wrong Ohm homograph are rejected. Use U+2126 for Ohm and the canonical `SERVICIOS_TURISTICOS_ICT` accessor for 06; its historical alias remains deprecated. Corrected0.4.2 document codes and aliases remain intact. Public monetary number DTOs and maintenance identity/rate guards are unchanged.

Independent libxml2/OpenSSL checks verify reference digests/RSA and reject tampering; packed consumers verify actual policy emission. This does not establish institutional response trust, certificate-chain/revocation status, full exact-decimal DTO integrity or real Hacienda acceptance. See docs/specs/a2-policy-catalog-readiness.md and existing advisory issue #69 before release/activation.
